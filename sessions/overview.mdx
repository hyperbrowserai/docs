# Hyperbrowser Sessions

Hyperbrowser Sessions give you instant access to cloud browsers through a simple API. Launch browsers in seconds, control them remotely, and run your automation workloads in our secure cloud - no infrastructure management required.

## Create Your First Session

Get started by creating your first Hyperbrowser session - check out our [Quickstart Guide](/sessions/quickstart) to spin up a session in minutes.

## What is a Session?

Sessions are the foundational building blocks of Hyperbrowser. Think of them as dedicated browser instances running in the cloud that you can control programmatically. Just like opening a new incognito window, each session provides:

- An isolated browser environment with its own state
- Separate cookie storage and local data
- Clean slate for web automation tasks
- Secure WebSocket connection for real-time control

Sessions are perfect for automated browser workflows that need to maintain separate contexts and state. Whether you're building web scrapers, testing tools, or automation systems, sessions provide the isolation and control you need.
