## Quick Example

Start automating in just a few lines of code:

import { connect } from "puppeteer-core";

const client = new Hyperbrowser({
  apiKey: process.env.HYPERBROWSER_API_KEY,
});

const session = await client.createSession();

// Use the session to automate browser actions
const browser = await connect({
  browserWSEndpoint: `${session.wsEndpoint}&apiKey=${process.env.HYPERBROWSER_API_KEY}`,
  defaultViewport: null,
});

// Use the browser to automate browser actions
const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto("https://example.com");
